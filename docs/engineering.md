## Engineering Study Add-ons

Study add-on engineers, please refer to the Official Engineering Documentation: https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/cookbooks/client_guidelines.html

Use the V5 branch of the utils (preferably starting from [mozilla/shield-studies-addon-template/](https://github.com/mozilla/shield-studies-addon-template/)) to create [Shield and Pioneer Add-on Experiments](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/FIREFOX/Pref-Flip+and+Add-On+Experiments) that manage their own life-cycle.

### Note: DO NOT USE These Old Template Repositories

Repositories that should not be used as templates for new studies:

* NO. <https://github.com/benmiroglio/shield-study-embedded-webextension-hello-world-example> - A repository that was created in 2017 to help new Shield/Pioneer engineers to quickly get up and running with a Shield add-on, built upon an older and much more verbose add-on template. It's documentation has been ported to the official template repo.
* NO. <https://github.com/johngruen/shield-template> - Despite its name, this repo is for static AMO consent pages and does not contain any template for Shield studies

## Engineering the Utils

To improve the utils in this repo, see [Development on the Utils](./development-on-the-utils.md).
