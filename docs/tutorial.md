# Tutorial Study:  Fake button study.


Learner goals:
1.  build a shield-instrumented Embedded Web Extension
2.  understand how probes, analysis, code relate


Concepts:
- technical terms
  - web extension
  - embedded web extension
  - Legacy (bootstrap) addon
- debugging techniques
  - `web-ext`
  - `about:debugging`
  - `run-firefox.js`


## Questions?

- start from empty dir, or from the finished project?
- how much to build in the first step.
- how to display the order of the steps?

(Steps, order unclear)

## project goal

## Analysis

## Engineering steps

### WebExtension with a button

### Multiple Button Choices

Make a class that has a startup at random.

### Send Message for Telemetry

Have a sendMessage language for this.

Work on TELEMETRY.md

### Embedded WebExtension

Plumb the listener

### incorporating shield to listen

- PERMANENT Randomization, revisited.
- Telemetry sending
- debugging
- helper addon

## Advanced

### Non embedded webExtension

## good probes

- good probes mirror the analysis.
- Analysis wants to be sql.  Try to make the probes reflect that.

## Why Shield-Utils?

## surveys?
