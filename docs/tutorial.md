# Tutorial Study: Fake button study.

Learner goals:

1. build a shield-instrumented Embedded Web Extension
2. understand how probes, analysis, code relate

Concepts:

* technical terms
  * web extension
  * embedded web extension
  * Legacy (bootstrap) add-on
* debugging techniques
  * `web-ext`
  * `about:debugging`
  * `run-firefox.js`

## Questions?

* start from empty dir, or from the finished project?
* how much to build in the first step.
* how to display the order of the steps?

(Steps, order unclear)

## Project goal

## Analysis

## Engineering steps

### WebExtension with a button

### Multiple Button Choices

Make a class that has a startup at random.

### Send Message for Telemetry

Have a sendMessage language for this.

Work on TELEMETRY.md

### Embedded WebExtension

Plumb the listener

### Incorporating shield to listen

* PERMANENT Randomization, revisited.
* Telemetry sending
* debugging
* helper add-on

## Advanced

### Non embedded webExtension

## Good probes

* good probes mirror the analysis.
* Analysis wants to be sql. Try to make the probes reflect that.

## Why Shield-Utils?

## Surveys?
